Description
This project contains some common project configurations for rebar.

Installation
To install, drop these into an existing ~/.rebar/templates. If you don't have
this directory you can clone directly into it.

$ git clone git://github.com/muxspace/rebar_templates.git ~/.rebar/templates

Library
A library is non-executable and is included as a dependency in other projects.
To set up a library, run the following command.

$ rebar create template=library appid=<app name>

Application
The application template is slightly different from the built-in simpleapp
template insomuch that it is designed for multi app support. Hence the 
directory structure is modified accordingly.

$ rebar create template=otpapp appid=<app name>

In addition, a Makefile is provided that picks up the app.src version and uses
that when building a release (assuming you've run create-node).

Nitrogen
This template will generate a fully functional app with two pages (based on 
the original templates). 

$ rebar create template=nitrogen appid=<app name> [port=8000]

To remove the example pages for a truly clean project, run 

$ make full-clean
