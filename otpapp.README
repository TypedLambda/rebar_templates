Build
To build the {{appid}} application just run make.
$ make

Release
Assuming you have run create-node to prepare a release, run make release. This
will generate a tar with the version number appended to the file name, based
on the version specified in the {{appid}}.app.src file.

$ make release

Running
If you're feeling lazy, you can run the app from the command line with 
$ make run
